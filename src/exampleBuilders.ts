// The example map BODIES — deliberately in their own module so they stay OUT of the entry chunk.
//
// Toolbar's "+ New…" dropdown needs only the example NAMES, but importing the array that held
// `build:` function references dragged every builder into the eager bundle: measured at 6.7 kB gz,
// carried on first load by every user whether or not they ever open an example.
//
// `src/examples.ts` now holds the name index and is the only thing eager code imports. Anything that
// actually BUILDS a map reaches this module — statically from the (lazy) Start screen, dynamically
// from the (eager) toolbar.
// THIS COPY STAYS ENGLISH (owner decision, 2026-07-26) — but it must stay TRUE when the chrome around
// it is translated, which is a separate obligation and the reason for the rule below.
//
// Do not quote a chrome LABEL in a note. "Open the Outline panel" names a control that will not be
// called that in a Danish UI, so the sentence stops being untranslated and starts being WRONG — and
// wrong in example content reads as the app lying to a new user, not as a missing translation.
//
// Describe the action, and keep the GLYPH as the finding aid: 🔗, 🧲, 📝, 🏷 and ↓ are not translated,
// so they still point at the right control in every locale. "Use 🔗 to point this topic at your
// Strategy map" survives; "🔗 Link" does not.
//
// Gestures ("drag", "double-click") and generic nouns ("topic", "layout") are fine — they describe
// what the user does, not what the button is called. Deliberately NOT reworded: "switch the layout to
// right-only" (describes the result; the label is "Right") and the four "Link me to your … map" topic
// texts (ordinary verb, not a quoted label).
